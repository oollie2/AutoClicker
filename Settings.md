| ExceptionLogging      | <p align="center">True</p>                                  | The application will automatically catch exceptions that happen and log   them to a file. Each exception is appended to the file throughout a day, and   a new file will be created the next day. If no file exists, no exceptions   have been caught. |
| ExceptionLogLocation  | <p align="center">%APPDATA%\oollie34\Auto Clicker\Logs\ </p> | The directory that the above exception logs are written to.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

If the value is 0 logs are not   deleted.                                                                                      |

In the future a settings window may be added to simplify this further, an example settings.xml file is included to show possible key code values.
