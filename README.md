# Auto Clicker

A WPF based fork of https://github.com/smith-j-travis/MinecraftAutoClicker
Currently targets Minecraft which can be updated further in the future.
A release will be available once the below list has been completed.

Known issues:

* Start button to actually running seems slow.
* ~~DispatcherTimer interval is set, but the actual result seems off.~~
* UI needs tidying.
* Hardly tested.. so more bugs may come along!
* For now.. if more than one instance is detected, nothing will happen.
* Also if no instances are detected, nothing will happen.
* A message box needs implementing for warnings / information.
